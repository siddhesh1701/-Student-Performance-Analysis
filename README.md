# -Student-Performance-Analysis
This project analyzes the performance of students in five subjects: Math, English, Science, Hindi, and Marathi. It calculates various metrics, generates plots, and produces an HTML report.
# Features:
# Data Analysis: 
Calculates total marks, percentage, mean, and standard deviation of scores.
# Ranking:
Assigns ranks to students based on their percentage scores.
# Color-Coded Grades: 
Applies color codes to scores based on grade ranges (green for 90+, orange for 70-89, red for 50-69).
# Color-Coded Ranks: 
Applies color codes to student names based on their ranks (dark green for 1st, orange for 2nd, red for 3rd).
# Subject-wise Plots: 
Generates bar plots for each subject, showing student performance.
# Overall Percentage Plot: 
Generates a bar plot showing overall percentage scores.
# HTML Report: 
Generates an HTML report containing the styled DataFrame, plots, and a timestamp.
# Usage:
Run the project to generate the analysis and plots.
Open the generated student_reports.html file to view the report.
# Requirements:
* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
# Restrictions:
The project assumes that all students have taken the same five subjects (Math, English, Science, Hindi, and Marathi).
If a student is missing scores for any subject, the program will  values with 0 to produce accurate results.
The project does not support adding or removing subjects dynamically.
# Note:
The program uses sample data, which can be replaced with actual student data or with the csv or xlsx files.
The project can be modified to accommodate additional subjects or customization as needed, but this will require changes to the code.
